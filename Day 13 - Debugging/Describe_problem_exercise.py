my_function()

# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing? It goes through numbers between 1 and 19 and prints 'You got it' when 20 comes.
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"? when i == 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i? i never gets to 20 cause of the range
